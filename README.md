## 🧩 Featured Projects

### 📊 Stock Market Prediction
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Stats  
**Description:** Developed a time-series model to predict stock returns using historical market data, & develop an allocation function using the predicted returns in the range of [0-2].  
**Key Features:**  
- Engineered features including lag, EMA, and rolling statistics  
- Trained ML model to forecast excess returns based on verifying various statistical assumptions, and visualizations
- Returned Allocation factor based on excess market returns
